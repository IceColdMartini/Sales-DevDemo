Given your budget of $100-150 and your mom's interest in anti-aging and hydration, I think we can put together a lovely gift set that feels both luxurious and thoughtful.\n\nSince our available products include the Tibbet Sandal Turmeric Soap at $55, which is gentle and nourishing, and the Keya Seth Neem Basil Face Wash at $180, I recommend focusing on skincare essentials that fit within your range. While the face wash exceeds your budget slightly, we can consider pairing the soap with a hydrating product like a hyaluronic acid serum or a gentle moisturizer from our local brands, which are both effective and affordable.\n\nFor example, a hydrating serum around $70-$80 combined with the turmeric soap would bring the total comfortably within your $100-150 range. These products can help boost her skin\u2019s moisture and elasticity, complementing her anti-aging routine.\n\nWould you like me to suggest specific serum or moisturizer options from our collection? I can also help with beautiful gift packaging to make it extra special. Let\u2019s create a thoughtful, luxurious gift that your mom will truly appreciate!",
