While I don't see a specific vitamin C serum in our current selection, I can recommend some options that are highly effective and suitable for sensitive skin.\n\nVitamin C serums are known for their antioxidant properties, helping to reduce signs of aging like fine lines and dullness, while also brightening the complexion. For sensitive skin, look for serums with gentle formulations, perhaps with added soothing ingredients like hyaluronic acid or aloe vera.\n\nRegarding moisturizers, we do have some excellent options tailored for sensitive skin. For example, the Keya Seth Aloe & Oat Moisturizer is lightweight, hydrating, and formulated to calm sensitive skin without irritation. It\u2019s a great addition to your routine to keep your skin nourished and protected.\n\nWould you like me to help you find specific vitamin C serums from international or local brands, or suggest a complete skincare routine that targets anti-aging and sensitivity? I\u2019m here to help you craft a personalized plan that works best for your skin. Feel free to share more about your skin concerns or preferences\u2014I'm excited to assist you on your journey to healthier, more youthful skin!",
