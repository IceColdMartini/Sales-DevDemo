While we currently don\u2019t have a dedicated vitamin C serum in our lineup, I can recommend some excellent options from trusted international brands that you might find beneficial. These serums are known for their potent antioxidant properties and skin-renewing benefits.\n\nRegarding moisturizers for sensitive skin, I suggest looking for gentle, fragrance-free formulas that hydrate without causing irritation. Our **Dove Sensitive Skin Nourishing Lotion** is a wonderful choice; it\u2019s dermatologist-recommended, lightweight, and designed specifically for sensitive skin types, providing deep moisture without any harsh ingredients.\n\nTo make the most of these products, I\u2019d recommend applying the vitamin C serum in the morning after cleansing, followed by a sensitive moisturizer to lock in hydration. Consistent use can really help improve skin texture and radiance over time.\n\nWould you like me to help you find specific vitamin C serums from international brands we carry, or perhaps suggest some other products tailored to your skin concerns? I\u2019m here to help you craft a skincare routine that leaves your skin feeling refreshed and youthful!",
