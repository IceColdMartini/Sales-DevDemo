It sounds like your skin's been acting a bit unpredictable, switching between oily and dry, which can be tricky to manage. The good news is, with the right products, you can bring more balance and comfort to your skin.\n\nSince your skin varies, I recommend starting with gentle, versatile cleansers that can adapt to your skin\u2019s needs. For example, our Keya Seth Neem Basil Face Wash is a great option\u2014it\u2019s formulated to cleanse without stripping moisture, helping to control oil while nourishing dry patches.

Also, incorporating a toner with ingredients like witch hazel or rose water can help regulate oil and soothe dry areas.\n\nTo personalize your routine further, I\u2019d suggest observing how your skin reacts to different products and adjusting accordingly.
