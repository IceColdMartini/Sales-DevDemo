Since you mentioned having combination skin that's acting up lately, it\u2019s important to find gentle yet effective products that balance oil and hydration without over-drying.\n\nGiven your interest, I recommend trying the Keya Seth Neem Basil Face Wash. It\u2019s formulated specifically for skin that needs a bit of extra care\u2014Neem and Basil are known for their soothing and antibacterial properties, which can help calm breakouts and reduce excess oil, while still being gentle enough for daily use. Plus, it\u2019s a great local option that offers quality at a reasonable price.\n\nTo complement the face wash, you might consider adding a lightweight moisturizer suited for combination skin, and perhaps a mattifying toner to help control shine throughout the day. I\u2019d be happy to suggest some options from our international brands or local lines based on your preferences.\n\nWould you like some recommendations for serums or treatments that target specific concerns like breakouts or dullness?

Given your budget of $100\u2013$150 and her love for skincare, I think we can definitely put together a lovely, pampering set that she\u2019ll truly appreciate.\n\nSince she\u2019s interested in anti-aging and hydration, I recommend focusing on a few key products. For example, a vitamin C serum from a trusted brand like La Roche-Posay or The Ordinary would be great for brightening and reducing signs of aging. Pairing that with a hydrating moisturizer containing hyaluronic acid can give her skin a lovely plump and radiant look.\n\nLooking at our current options, while some individual products like the Dove Moisturizing Soap are affordable, for a gift set, I\u2019d suggest combining a serum (around $20\u2013$30) with a hydrating moisturizer (around $15\u2013$25). You could also add a small nourishing product like a facial oil or a gentle cleanser to complete the routine.\n\nTo stay within your budget, I can help you select a couple of these products and even suggest some beautifully packaged gift sets from our local brands like Keya Seth, which focus on natural ingredients and gentle care\u2014perfect for mature skin.\n\nWould you like me to curate a specific set for you or provide links to some top picks?

Given your budget of $100\u2013$150 and her love for skincare, I think we can definitely put together a lovely, pampering set that she\u2019ll truly appreciate.\n\nSince she\u2019s interested in anti-aging and hydration, I recommend focusing on a few key products. For example, a vitamin C serum from a trusted brand like La Roche-Posay or The Ordinary would be great for brightening and reducing signs of aging. Pairing that with a hydrating moisturizer containing hyaluronic acid can give her skin a lovely plump and radiant look.\n\nLooking at our current options, while some individual products like the Dove Moisturizing Soap are affordable, for a gift set, I\u2019d suggest combining a serum (around $20\u2013$30) with a hydrating moisturizer (around $15\u2013$25). You could also add a small nourishing product like a facial oil or a gentle cleanser to complete the routine.\n\nTo stay within your budget, I can help you select a couple of these products and even suggest some beautifully packaged gift sets from our local brands like Keya Seth, which focus on natural ingredients and gentle care\u2014perfect for mature skin.\n\nWould you like me to curate a specific set for you or provide links to some top picks? I\u2019d love to help you create a thoughtful, luxurious gift for your mom!",

For example, our Dove Gentle Skin Cleanser is gentle yet effective, and it\u2019s usually quite budget-friendly. Pair it with a simple moisturizer like Dove\u2019s Essential Nourishing Lotion, which provides hydration without breaking the bank.\n\nIf you\u2019re open to exploring local brands, Keya Seth offers some natural, affordable skincare products that are gentle and effective as well. Their face washes and moisturizers are popular among customers looking for budget-friendly options.\n\nTo make it easier, I can recommend specific products based on your skin type (oily, dry, sensitive). Just let me know a bit about your skin, and I\u2019ll tailor my suggestions! Also, keep an eye out for any ongoing deals or bundles\u2014sometimes you can get more value for less.\n\nWould you like me to send you some links or help you choose based on your skin type?
